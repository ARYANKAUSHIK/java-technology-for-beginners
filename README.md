# java-technology-for-beginners
In my 15 years of designing and developing more than 100 java web applications, there are a number of terminologies, standards, frameworks, tools that I have used. I know how difficult it is for a beginner to understand them. And the business guys! So, this guide is to demystify these terms! 

As I find time, I will create more videos. Request some patience :)
