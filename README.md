# java-technology-for-beginners
In my 15 years of designing and developing more than 100 java web applications, I have learnt that techies love coining new terminologies. They are great as we don't need to explain each time but imagine the state of a beginning programmer or a non techie - a Tester or Business Analyst or your Product Owner. They hardly understand them. This guide is to demystify these terms through videos! 

As I find time, I will create more videos. Request some patience :) 

If you think, I'm missing an important topic, shoot an email or create a pull request!

If you have a great video for one of these topics, which does not have a video attached, submit a pull request!
